# Solo Staking with Web3 Pi

!!! warning "Under Development & High Risk"

    Web3 Pi does not currently offer official support for staking configurations. Proceed at your own risk.

While Web3 Pi provides the necessary Execution and Consensus client foundation, configuring it securely and reliably for staking requires significant technical expertise beyond the standard setup.

You are welcome to explore configuring your node for staking independently, but please be aware:

- **This is an advanced procedure.**
- Web3 Pi **does not currently offer official support** for staking configurations.
- You proceed **entirely at your own risk.** Mistakes can lead to financial penalties (slashing).

We strongly recommend thoroughly understanding the responsibilities and substantial risks involved before attempting solo staking.
