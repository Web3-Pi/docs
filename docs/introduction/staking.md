# Can I Earn with Web3 Pi?

!!! warning

    Staking configuration is currently considered an advanced, unsupported procedure. Proceed with extreme caution if exploring this path independently.

Web3 Pi provides the software tools to run the core components of an Ethereum node easily on a Raspberry Pi. While Web3 Pi itself doesn't directly generate earnings, the node infrastructure it sets up _can potentially_ be used as a foundation for **Ethereum staking**.

Staking involves locking up ETH (currently 32 ETH) to help secure the network and validate transactions. In return for this service, stakers receive ETH rewards.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Official Support:** Web3 Pi does **not** currently offer any official support for staking.
- **Advanced Users:** Setting up a staking node requires significant technical understanding beyond the basic Web3 Pi setup. This includes managing validator keys, ensuring near-perfect uptime, and configuring both Execution and Consensus clients correctly for staking duties.
- **High Risk:** If you choose to configure your Web3 Pi node for staking independently, you do so **entirely at your own risk**. Mistakes in setup or maintenance can lead to financial penalties (slashing) and loss of funds. Be extremely careful when dealing with real ETH.

If you are considering staking, it is crucial that you thoroughly research and understand the process, responsibilities, and significant risks involved _before_ attempting it.
