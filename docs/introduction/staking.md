# Can I Earn with Web3 Pi?

!!! warning

    Running an Ethereum validator involves significant financial risk and technical responsibility. You do so entirely at your own risk.

Running a standard Ethereum node with Web3 Pi does not directly generate income by itself. Its primary purpose is providing secure, private, and performant access to the blockchain. However, Web3 Pi serves as a foundation for potential earning opportunities:

* **Solo Staking:** While running a node doesn't require 32 ETH, staking to secure the network and earn rewards does. Web3 Pi hardware (like Raspberry Pi 5) is capable of handling staking duties (proven in tests running 200 validators), although the setup currently requires manual configuration. We aim to simplify this process significantly in the future.
* **RPC Monetization:** Through collaborations like the one with Golem Network, there are plans to allow Web3 Pi node operators to share RPC endpoint and potentially earn rewards (e.g., in GLM tokens) for serving requests. (This feature is not yet available.)

If you are considering staking, it is crucial that you thoroughly research and understand the process, responsibilities, and significant risks involved before attempting it.
