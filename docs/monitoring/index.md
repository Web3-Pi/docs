# Monitoring Your Node

Keeping an eye on your Ethereum node is crucial for ensuring it runs smoothly, stays synced, and uses resources efficiently. Web3 Pi includes several built-in tools to help you monitor different aspects of your setup:

1.  **[Installation Monitor](installation-monitor.md):**
    A simple web page exposed by your Pi that displays information about the system's setup status. While always available, it's **most useful during the initial installation** to track the progress of automated steps in real-time.

2.  **[Grafana Dashboards](grafana.md):**
    Provides detailed, graphical dashboards visualizing the performance and status of your Ethereum clients. Ideal for in-depth performance monitoring once the node is running.

3.  **[LCD Display](lcd.md):**
    If you've installed the optional LCD hardware, this small screen provides an at-a-glance view of key system information like IP address, hostname, CPU usage, and memory, directly on the device.

4.  **[HTTP API](system-monitor.md):**
    Offers a programmatic way to query node status and metrics. Useful for integration with custom scripts or external monitoring systems.

Refer to the specific pages linked above for details on how to access and use each monitoring tool.
