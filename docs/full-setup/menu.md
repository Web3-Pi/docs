# Web 3 Pi: Setup Guide

This guide gives instructions for setting up the hardware and software you'll need to run an Ethereum node on a Raspberry Pi.

You'll create a Raspberry boot card containing Web3 Pi, assemble the hardware if necessary, and install and activate the node.

Flashing the boot card may be slow if you don't have a fast microSD card and writer. If this is the case, you may like to begin this process, and assemble the hardware while it's in progress.

The hardware assembly instructions are based on the Welcome Box, but will also be useful to users assembling or adding to their own hardware.

After setup, the node takes about 19 hours to sync with Ethereum, so allow for this process. You'll need to monitor the installation from time to time to make sure no problems are encountered.

## ⚠️Disclaimer ⚠️

The Web3 Pi is a community driven project and it is currently in its early development phase (Proof of Concept) and consists of components provided by third-party manufacturers,including but not limited to Raspberry Pi, enclosures, power supplies, storage drives,microSD cards, etc. While the Web3 Pi team rigorously tests all functionalities, we cannot guarantee the performance or compatibility of individual components or solutions at this stage.

By engaging with Web3 Pi products during this early phase of development, the “Early Bird” user assumes full responsibility for any interactions with these products. The use of Web3 Pi solutions is at the user’s own risk, and the team does not bear any liability for issues that may arise during this period of initial testing and experimentation.
