# Troubleshooting

## My node cannot synchronize

Synchronization issues can stem from several causes. First, check your internet connection quality - unstable or slow connections significantly delay the synchronization process. Also ensure your NVMe SSD has sufficient capacity (minimum 2TB) and is functioning properly. Overheating can also slow down or interrupt synchronization, so verify that your CPU cooling is working correctly.

If your Raspberry Pi 4 is synchronizing too slowly, remember this is normal - the process is much faster on Raspberry Pi 5. You can check synchronization progress in the Web3 Pi panel and verify if the node is actually downloading new blocks.

If the problem persists, check:
- Whether your firewall is blocking required ports
- If the SSD is properly mounted and recognized by the system
- If you have the latest version of Web3 Pi software
