# Advanced Setup: Power over Ethernet (PoE)

Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a networking feature that allows network cables to carry electrical power in addition to data. By using PoE, you can power your Web3 Pi Raspberry Pi using the same Ethernet cable that provides its network connection, eliminating the need for a separate USB-C power adapter.

This can simplify cable management and potentially allow for centralized power backup if your network switch is connected to a UPS.

## Benefits of Using PoE

- **Simplified Wiring:** Reduces cable clutter by combining power and data into a single Ethernet cable run to the Raspberry Pi.
- **Flexible Placement:** Allows placing the Raspberry Pi further from power outlets, as long as an Ethernet cable can reach it.
- **Centralized Power Backup:** If your PoE-providing network switch or injector is connected to a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), your Raspberry Pi will also benefit from backup power.
