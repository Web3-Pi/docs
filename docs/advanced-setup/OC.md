# Overclocking

## Raspberry Pi 5

There are two things that can be tweaked on the Raspberry Pi 5 to increase Ethereum Node performance.

- CPU frequency
- PCIe generation

!!! note "Note about PCIe generation settings"

    This makes sense only if using a PCIe to m.2 adapter for storage.

### CPU Overclocking

By default, the Raspberry Pi 5 CPU clock is set to 2.4 GHz, but it is relatively easy to overclock. An overclocked CPU with a significant load will require an active cooling solution or a high-quality cooling case.

The maximum stable clock that can be achieved depends on a particular device.

Safe for all devices is 2.6 GHz.
The reasonable top is 3.0 GHz.

The Raspberry Pi has enough power to handle an Ethereum node without OC, so our recommendation is to keep stable settings like 2.6 GHz.

#### How to overclock the CPU

- Edit the _/boot/firmware/config.txt_ file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
  ```
- Find the last `[pi5]` section, almost at the end of the file. Look for this comment:
  ```bash
   [rpi5]
   # Overclocking for Raspberry Pi 5
   # Active cooling is required
   over_voltage_delta=50000
   arm_freq=2800
   #2400MHz is default
   #3000MHz is max (not all boards will work stable)
   #2800MHz is reasonable OC
  ```
- Exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+x` and save the changes.
- Restart the device:
  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  ```
- After reboot, you can check if the frequency is correctly recognized by the OS.

  ```bash
  sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq
  ```

  It should output `2600000`

If the procedure is successful, the device should be up and running with the updated OC settings.

### PCIe generation select

The Raspberry Pi by default uses PCIe gen 2. But the Broadcom BCM2712 offers PCIe generation 3, which is twice as fast.
By default, it is set to gen 2 because of compatibility reasons with different adapters.
In most cases, you can safely set it to gen 3, which can double the performance of the NVMe drive.

- Edit the _/boot/firmware/config.txt_ file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
  ```
- Find the last `[pi5]` section, almost at the end of the file. Look for this comment:
  ```bash
   #Enable PCIe
   dtparam=pciex1
   #Enable PCIe gen.3 (default is gen.2)
   dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
  ```
- Exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+x` and save the changes.
- Restart the device:
  ```bash
  sudo reboot
  ```

## Raspberry Pi 4

To overclock the Raspberry Pi 4, you need to edit the config.txt file located in the /boot/firmware/ directory.

1. **Access the File:**

   - Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Edit the `config.txt` file using a text editor such as `nano`.

   ```sh
   sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
   ```

2. **Add Overclocking Settings:**

   - Uncomment the following lines near the end of the `config.txt` file. Adjust the values based on your desired overclock settings and the stability of your system.

   ```ini
   [pi4]
   over_voltage=6
   arm_freq=1800
   gpu_freq=600
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - `over_voltage=6`: Increases the core voltage. Values range from 0 to 8. Higher values increase stability but also generate more heat.
   - `arm_freq=1800`: Sets the CPU frequency to 1800 MHz (1.8 GHz).
     - The default is 1500 MHz
     - Moderate OC is 1800 MHz
     - A high overclock is 2000 MHz
   - `gpu_freq=600`: Sets the GPU frequency to 600 MHz.
     - The default is 500 MHz
     - Moderate OC is 600 MHz
     - A high overclock is 750 MHz

3. **Save and Reboot:**

   - Save the file (`Ctrl+O` and `Enter` in nano) and exit the text editor (`Ctrl+X` in nano).
   - Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes.

   ```sh
   sudo reboot
   ```

## Raspberry Pi CM4

Overclocking the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) is similar to overclocking the Raspberry Pi 4, but there are a few key differences to consider due to the form factor and intended use cases of the CM4.

### Similarities

1. **Configuration File:**
   - Both use the `config.txt` file located in the `/boot` directory for overclocking settings.
2. **Overclocking Parameters:**

   - Parameters such as `over_voltage`, `arm_freq`, and `gpu_freq` are used in the same way to adjust voltage, CPU frequency, and GPU frequency.

3. **Monitoring and Testing:**
   - Tools and methods for monitoring temperature, checking for throttling, and stress testing are the same.

### Differences

1. **Form Factor and Cooling:**

   - The CM4 is designed to be used with custom carrier boards, which may affect cooling solutions. Ensure your carrier board design allows for adequate cooling, especially when overclocking.

2. **Power Supply:**
   - The power supply and power delivery to the CM4 might be different depending on the carrier board. Ensure that the carrier board can supply sufficient power for overclocking.

## Monitoring and Stability

1. **Monitor Temperatures**

   - Use tools like `vcgencmd` to monitor the temperature of your Raspberry Pi.

   ```sh
   vcgencmd measure_temp
   ```

   - Ideally, temperatures should remain below 85Â°C. If temperatures are higher, consider improving your cooling solution.

2. **Stress Test**

   - Run stress tests to ensure stability. The `stress` tool can be used for this purpose.

   ```sh
   sudo apt install stress
   stress --cpu 4 --timeout 600
   ```

3. **Check for Throttling**

   - Use `vcgencmd` to check if the Raspberry Pi is throttling due to high temperatures or insufficient power.

   ```sh
   vcgencmd get_throttled
   ```

   - A result of `0x0` indicates no throttling.

## Safety Tips

1. **Incremental Changes:** Start with small increments and gradually increase the values. Monitor stability and temperatures at each step.
2. **Cooling:** Ensure you have sufficient cooling. Consider adding a fan or better heatsinks if necessary.
3. **Power Supply:** Use a high-quality power supply that can handle the increased power demands.
4. **Testing:** Perform extensive testing to ensure that your system remains stable under load.

## Conclusion

Overclocking the Raspberry Pi can provide significant performance improvements, making it more capable for an Ethereum node. However, it is crucial to approach overclocking with caution, ensuring adequate cooling and power supply, and thoroughly testing for stability. By following these guidelines, you can safely and effectively overclock your Raspberry Pi to meet your performance needs.
