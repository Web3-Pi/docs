# Managing Your Node

Once your Web3 Pi node is up and running, you'll occasionally need to interact with it for monitoring, updates, or configuration changes. There are two primary ways to manage the underlying system:

1.  **[SSH (Secure Shell)](ssh.md):**
    Provides direct command-line access to the Ubuntu operating system. This is the most powerful method, suitable for advanced configuration, troubleshooting, and running specific commands.

2.  **[Cockpit Web Interface](cockpit/dashboard.md):**
    Offers a user-friendly, web-based dashboard for monitoring system resources (CPU, RAM, disk), viewing logs, and performing basic administrative tasks directly from your browser.

Choose the tool that best suits the task at hand. For routine checks and system overview, Cockpit is often sufficient. For more advanced tasks, SSH is the way to go.
